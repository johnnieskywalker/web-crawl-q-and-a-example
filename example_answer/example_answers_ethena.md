# Question1
USDe is pegged to USD by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. The protocol earns yield from the staked assets and the funding and basis spread from the delta hedging derivatives positions. The protocol yield is denominated in the native asset - for example, liquid staked ETH tokens are typically denominated in ETH. The funding and basis spread can be floating or fixed depending upon if the protocol uses non-deliverable or deliverable derivatives positions to hedge the backing asset delta. The funding and basis spread has historically generated a positive yield given the mismatch in demand and supply for leverage in crypto as well as the existence of positive baseline funding. The protocol yield is denominated in the native asset - for example, liquid staked ETH tokens are
Yes, sUSDe is a reward bearing token. It uses the same standard as USDe, which is the Ethena protocol. The Ethena protocol is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated 'savings instrument' - the 'Internet Bond'. Ethena's synthetic dollar, USDe, provides the crypto-native, scalable solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. This enables the synthetic USD value of the collateral to remain relatively stable in most market conditions. Ethena does not use any material leverage to margin the delta hedging derivatives positions beyond the natural state as a result of exchanges applying
LUSD is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated 'savings instrument' - the 'Internet Bond'. LUSD's synthetic dollar, LUSD, provides the crypto-native, scalable solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. This enables the synthetic USD value of the collateral to remain relatively stable in most market conditions. LUSD does not use any material leverage to margin the delta hedging derivatives positions beyond the natural state as a result of exchanges applying slight discounts to the value of liquid staked assets to the extent used as backing and margin collateral on the initial hedge and issuance of LUSD.

USDe is pegged to the USD, but the peg is not enforced by a central authority. Instead, the peg is maintained by the protocol's automated hedging mechanism. The protocol's hedging mechanism is designed to maintain a delta-neutral position with respect to the backing assets.

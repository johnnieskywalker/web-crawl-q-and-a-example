Fast forward to 2023: With the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, customer demand for AI applications was vastly accelerated.The Salesforce team began exploring OpenAIâs models and embeddings. Very quickly, its teams saw an opportunity to marry Salesforceâs 360 degree view of the customer with OpenAIâs powerful capabilities. Generative AI is powerful for freeing sales, marketing, service, and IT professionals from rote tasks.Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AISalesforce turned to OpenAI to be its first model used to deliver generative AI experiences inside the Salesforce Einstein AI Platform. Salesforce and OpenAI worked together to provide Salesforce customers with out-of-the-box generative AI capabilities for Sales and Service use cases. Salesforce knew working with OpenAI was the right choice for an enterprise deployment, as OpenAI met core security requirements with data encryption, custom data retention, advanced system controls, SOC-2 compliance, and the necessary policies to ensure models do not train on company data or API usage.Â Building on this strong AI foundation and no code/low code platform, Salesforce added generative AI capabilities to each of its applications, from Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to Commerce Cloud and others, in addition to offering a robust no code/low code/pro code platform for customers, partners, and developers to easily and safely build AI applications.Â Salesforceâs AI features can now accelerate every step of the employee workflow. For example, sales reps can quickly summarize customer accounts and opportunities as they are walking into a meeting, and service teams can auto-generate personalized service representative chat replies and case summaries. And with Einstein Copilot Studio, companies can build and tailor AI assistants to accomplish specific sales, service, marketing, commerce, and IT tasks. The result is end customers experiencing better, faster, and more personalized support from brands they love.Â The partnership has gone beyond delivering impactful business software. For Salesforce, trust is the number one value. Salesforceâs customers were eager to embrace generative AI, but were wary of risks. In response, Salesforce introduced the Einstein Trust Layer, a secure AI architecture natively built into Salesforce that allows teams to generate higher-quality AI results by grounding responses with customer data while preserving their companyâs data privacy and security standards. Combined with OpenAIâs foundation of safety & trust capabilities, enterprises working with Salesforce know they can securely implement theirÂ  AI-driven strategy. In this rapidly evolving AI landscape, trust is consistently cited as our customersâ top concernâand also the top opportunity when it comes to making generative AI viable for businesses. By working with partners such as OpenAI, and infusing trust into everything we do together, we are delivering the future of successful, trusted AI.Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AIIn partnership with OpenAI, Salesforce has delivered innovative new features for thousands of organizations. It's just the beginning, as Salesforce continues to find ways to deliver better, faster, and more personalized experiences powered by secure generative AI.Â ResearchOverviewIndexGPT-4DALLÂ·E 3SoraAPIOverviewPricingDocsChatGPTOverviewTeamEnterprisePricingTry ChatGPTCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityCustomer storiesSafetyOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2024Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top

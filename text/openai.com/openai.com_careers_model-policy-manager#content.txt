We co-design policy with models and for models. Key focus areas include: addressing critical societal challenges like misinformation risks and how the model should respond in health contexts; defining evaluation criteria for foundational modelsâ ability to reason about safety, values, and questions of cultural norms; and driving rapid policy taxonomy iteration based on data.Â About the RoleProviding access to powerful AI models introduces a host of challenging questions when it comes to model safety: How do we define safe behavior for how a model should behave? To what end? How do we do this in such a way that is actionable, objective and sustains replicability?Â This is a senior role in which youâll help shape policy creation and development at OpenAI and make an impact by helping ensure that our groundbreaking technologies are truly used to benefit all people.

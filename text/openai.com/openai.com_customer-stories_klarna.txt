When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, Klarna Co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski immediately saw the potential. Klarna became the first European company and the first fintech firm globally to launch a ChatGPT pluginâwhich was just the beginning.Â âWe push everyone to test, test, test and explore,â said Siemiatkowski. âAs Klarna continues to discover applications for OpenAIâs tech, thereâs the potential to take the business to new heights. Weâre aimed at achieving a new level of employee empowerment, enhancing both our teamâs performance and the customer experience.â We push everyone to test, test, test and explore.

If youâre shopping for sneakers, for example, you have to search through thousands of similar products to find one with the characteristics you want. Then you need to compare prices across a vast array of online stores.Â Instead, imagine being able to ask an AI tool to give you sneaker recommendations for under $150âand being able to refine your search through a conversational interface. This is the vision behind Klarnaâs shopping plugin for ChatGPT. When a ChatGPT user has the GPT installed, a customer can have a conversation about an item theyâre looking for and get suggestions from ChatGPT, with product links pointing to Klarnaâs search & compare tool for price comparison.Â âThe capabilities of AI technology are not only addressing existing challenges, but also rapidly advancing how we can enhance the consumer experience for the near future,â said Martin Elwin, Senior Director of Engineering at Klarna.
